%Volume data is widely used in scientific and medical research, and volume visualization has been proven to be an effective and flexible method for visualizing complex structures. However, obtaining clear visualization of features of interest in volume data is still a major challenge.
%Due to the 3D occlusion between structures, it is a time-consuming and unintuitive task to specify appropriate transfer functions to clearly reveal the features of interest. In practice, transfer functions are often specified in a trial and error manner with careful observation of changes in the resulting images.

Volume data is widely used in scientific and medical research, and volume visualization techniques aim to provide effective and flexible methods for analyzing and exploring complex structures in such data. However, obtaining clear visualization of features of interest in volume data is still a major challenge.
One time-consuming and unitintuitive part of the process is the specification of an appropriate transfer function, which determines the classification and visibility of features. In practice, this is typically achieved using a trial-and-error approach: modifications are made to the transfer function and changes in the resulting visualization are carefully observed in order to inform further modifications to the transfer function.
%Due to this indirect control over the final visualization, further exacerbated by 3D occlusion between structures, it is a difficult task to specify appropriate transfer functions to clearly reveal specific features of interest in the volume data set.

This thesis proposes and investigates novel automated optimization techniques for transfer functions, in order to emphasize features of interest. These techniques exploit information content associated with volume data and objective measures based on visual saliency and visibility in volume visualization.

We describe a global optimization and two user-driven refinement methods for modulating transfer functions in order to assist the exploration of volume data.
This optimization is dependent on the distribution of the scalar values of the volume data set and is designed to reduce general occlusion and improve the clarity of layers of structures in the resulting images.
%The user can explore a volume by interactively specifying different priority intensity ranges and observe which layers of structures are revealed. In addition, we show how the technique can be applied to time-varying volume data sets by adaptively refining the transfer function based on the histogram of each time-step. 
%Experimental results on various data sets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
%The clarity of features depends on the transfer function, the viewpoint and the spatial distribution of features in the volume data set.
%In addition to view-independent information (i.e. entropy of voxels), we propose visibility-weighted saliency as a view-dependent measure of features in volume rendered images, in order to assist users in choosing suitable viewpoints and designing effective transfer functions to visualize the features of interest.
%Visibility-weighted saliency is based on a computational measure of perceptual importance of voxels and the visibility of features in volume rendered images.
%The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated by test results on various volume data sets.

In addition to view-independent information, % (i.e. entropy of voxels), 
we propose a novel view-dependent measure called visibility-weighted saliency in order to assist users in choosing suitable viewpoints and designing effective transfer functions to visualize the features of interest in a volume rendered images. This measure is based on a computational measure of perceptual importance of voxels and the visibility of features in volume rendered images.

%The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated by test results on various volume data sets.
Subsequently, we present an automated transfer function optimization method based on the visibility-weighted saliency metric. This method takes into account the perceptual importance of voxels and the visibility of features, and automatically adjusts the transfer function to match the target saliency levels specified by the user. In addition, a parallel line search strategy is presented to improve the performance of the optimization algorithm.

Finally, we describe a multivariate visualization approach which modulates focus, emphasizing important information, by adjusting saturation and brightness of voxels based on an importance measure derived from temporal and multivariate information.
%The method was tested in visualizing a multivariate hurricane data set. The results suggest that our approach can give the user an intuitive understanding of the data by presenting multivariate information variables in one self-contained visualization.

%Volume visualization is a powerful technique for depicting layered structures in 3D volume data sets.
%Volume visualization has been widely used to depict complicated 3D structures in volume data sets.
%However, it is a major challenge to obtain clear visualizations of a volume with important structures clearly revealed.
%This thesis examines the methods for exploring of volume data by optimization of visualization parameters and through the use of focus and context visualization techniques by selectively enhancing important parts of the data sets.
%Time-varying volume data is used in many areas of science and engineering. However, visualizations of such data are not easy for users to visually process due to the amount of information that can be presented simultaneously.
%By conducting a voxel-wise analysis of a number of consecutive frames, we acquire a volatility measure of each voxel. We then use intensity, volatility and additional multivariate information to determine opacity, saturation and brightness of the voxels.

%Volume data is widely used in scientific and medical research, and volume visualization has been proven to be an effective and flexible method for visualizing complex structures within volume data.
%In recent years, volume visualization has received increasing attention in the analysis of dynamics and evolution of phenomena in a variety of application domains, including medicine, meteorology, astrophysics and engineering.
%However, the size and complexity of the parameter space controlling the rendering process makes it challenging to generate an informative rendering.
%In particular, the specification of the transfer function (which is a mapping from data values to visual properties ) is frequently a time-consuming and unintuitive task.

%We propose a novel approach to optimize the transfer functions in volume visualization by exploiting the information inherent within the volume data.
%We hypothesize that the importance of voxels (sample values in volume data) are associated with their information content. Therefore, the transfer functions of volume visualization can be optimized based on the information within the data sets. The user's interests are also taken into account in this approach through interactive input (such as user-selected regions).
%This optimization approach reduces the occlusion in the resulting images, and thus improves the perception of structures in the rendered images.
%In particular we believe our approach will be useful in visualizing time-varying details by adaptively optimizing the visualization parameters according to the changes over time.

\chapter*{Glossary}

\begin{description}
	
\item Entropy

Entropy (or Shannon entropy) is a basic concept in information theory to measure the uncertainty of a random variable.
	
\item Feature

A feature in a volume is a subset of voxels in the volume. In this thesis, features are specified by intensity ranges in transfer functions.

\item Multivariate volume data

Multivariate volume data are volume data that contain multiple variables in each voxel, e.g. a data set containing variables from multiple modalities such as CT, MRI, and PET.

\item Saliency

Saliency (or visual saliency), for images, is the distinct subjective perceptual quality which makes some regions in an image stand out from their neighbors and immediately grab the user's attention.

\item Saliency field

A saliency field for a volume data set represents the saliency (see above) of each voxel in the volume dataset. This field itself could be represented in the form of a volume data set.
	
\item Saliency model

A saliency model (or saliency map) is a computational model that integrates the normalized information from feature filters for visual properties such as color, intensity and orientation into one global measure of visual saliency.

\item Saturation

Saturation is a concept in color theory, which refers to the perceived purity or vividness of a specific color.

\item Time-variant volume data

Time-variant volume is a form of data that typically consists of a series of time-steps (frames) of volume data representing how a system of model changes over time.

\item Transfer function

Transfer functions are mappings that assign visual properties to volume data. This is a recurrent component of most volume visualization techniques.

\item Visibility

The visibility of a voxel is the contribution of a voxel to the volume rendered image, which is determined by both the opacity of this voxel and the opacity of those voxels in front of the current voxel in the view direction.

\item Visibility field

A visibility field for a volume data set represents the visibility of each voxel in the volume data set. This field itself could be represented in the form of a volume data set.

\item Visibility histogram

Visibility histograms summarize the distribution of visibility of voxels from a given viewpoint. They are feedback mechanisms of volume visualization.

\item Volume data

Volume data are discretely sampled along 3D grids and contain scalar values that are usually acquired from medical imaging devices such as CT or MRI machines or computed from scientific simulations such as fluid simulations.

\item Voxel

Elements in volume data sets are called voxels, which are analogues to pixels in 2D images.
